A project in which I used JavaScript, SCSS and also the BEM methodology. You can watch it here: https://mateuszswies.github.io/coffeeLovers/

A sample site on which I wanted to test my skills and show that I am able to use them to create an independent project.

I made this site in mobile-first convention so it is fully responsive
